#= Ranked Choice Voting simulation
Basic 4-choice implementation of ranked choice voting.
When a voter's first choice is eliminated from the running, their second will be
used to re-tally results, and so on until a candidate has a majority

Inputs to the results will be weighted preference of candidates and write-in
options, as well as the number of voters.

TODO(ttaylor) maybe axes of different policy paradigms (e.g. economic views vs
social views) used to determine relative preference of candidates
